# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection

## Project Overview

Real-Time Drowsiness Detection is a computer vision and deep learning based project that aims to detect driver drowsiness in real time using a camera. The system observes the driver’s face and eye movements from live video input. If the driver shows signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure, the system generates an alert to warn the driver.

The main purpose of this project is to help reduce road accidents caused by drowsy driving. This system is designed to be low-cost, non-intrusive, and easy to use because it uses only a normal camera instead of wearable sensors like EEG devices.

## Problem Statement

Drowsy driving is one of the major causes of road accidents. Many drivers become tired during long-distance travel, night driving, or continuous driving without rest. In such situations, drivers may lose concentration, close their eyes for a longer time, or fall asleep while driving.

Existing drowsiness detection methods are not always practical. Some systems depend on self-assessment, passenger monitoring, or wearable sensors. These methods may be uncomfortable, expensive, or unreliable in real-world driving conditions.

Therefore, this project proposes a camera-based real-time drowsiness detection system that can detect eye states using computer vision and CNN, and then give an immediate alert when drowsiness is detected.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system.
- To detect the driver’s face and eye region from live camera input.
- To classify eye states as open or closed using a CNN model.
- To identify drowsiness based on continuous eye closure.
- To generate an alert when the driver becomes drowsy.
- To build a low-cost and non-intrusive system for road safety.

## System Workflow

The working process of the system is described below:

1. The camera captures live video of the driver.
2. The system detects the driver’s face from the video frame.
3. The eye region is detected from the face.
4. The eye image is preprocessed before classification.
5. A CNN model classifies the eye state as open or closed.
6. If the eyes remain closed for a certain period, the system detects drowsiness.
7. An alert is generated to warn the driver.

## Methodology

This project follows a step-by-step methodology:

### 1. Data Collection

Eye images are collected or selected from a suitable dataset. The dataset contains images of open eyes and closed eyes.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The images are resized, normalized, and prepared for model training. Preprocessing helps the model learn better features from the input images.

### 3. Model Training

A CNN model is trained to classify eye states. The model learns the difference between open eyes and closed eyes.

### 4. Real-Time Detection

The trained model is integrated with OpenCV to detect eye states from live camera video.

### 5. Alert Generation

If the system detects that the driver’s eyes remain closed for a certain time, it triggers an alert to notify the driver.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this project are:

- A working real-time drowsiness detection system.
- A trained CNN model for eye state classification.
- Detection of driver drowsiness from live camera input.
- An alert system to warn the driver.
- Improved understanding of computer vision and deep learning applications.
- A practical solution that can contribute to road safety.
